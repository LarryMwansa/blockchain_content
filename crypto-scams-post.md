#scammersbeware Crypto Investment Scams. 

In the last 3-5 months I have received many offers from so called crypto trading experts offering me pie in the sky deals on my Facebook DM. SAD!! As an Blockchain Instructor training people on blockchain basics, I have met many victims of crypto scams. They were either roped into the systems as ambassadors or as investors. 

I have come to understand as well that many believe crypto scams to be synonymous with cryptocurrency. Because many got educated by scammers. The only "use case" is the one provided by the scammers so they know no better.

Here is a video by Scambaiter exposing a crypto scam in Cyprus. I hope you can learn something and prevent yourself from falling victim. And if you have been a victim tell you story in the comments.
